# TDI - A successful replication of Dormio TDI (Horowitz et al. 2018), software, hardware and user study

This repository contains the code used to make our own implementation of the Targeted Dream Incubation protocol and the scripts used to analyse the data. 
The Arduino board code, and TDI code should be reusable without major changes; however some of the analysis scripts rely on the particular data structures or file formats used in the experiment and thus are mainly here for reference.
